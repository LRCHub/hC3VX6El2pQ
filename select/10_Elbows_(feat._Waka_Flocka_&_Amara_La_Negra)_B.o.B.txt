I really, really wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now
I really, really wanna rock right now
I wanna see your ass in your elbows
I wanna see your ass in your elbows
(Shoulders, knees, toes)
(Shoulders, knees, toes)
(Shoulders, knees, toes)
I wanna see your ass in your elbows

I wanna see that ass on the mailbox, bitch
Hol' up out a dolla, like crabflow, bitch
I give her snaps on a Pedro, bitch
And she go H.A.M. On a breadrow
Feelin' zesty, kissin' on her bestie
Archive, archive, archive, archive
Both hands needed like a jet-ski
Head on my iCloud, ass on my hard drive
Keep dancin' mamma, pose
Through the wood in the morning, you will see a nigga walk
And that ass on woke, and them titties on perc
When you gon' twerk, bitch?

Head, knees, shoulders, toes (yeah, yeah)
Head, knees, shoulders, toes (yeah, yeah)
I wanna see your ass in your elbows
(Shoulders, knees, toes)
(Shoulders, knees, toes)
(Shoulders, knees, toes)
(Shoulders, knees, toes)
I really, really wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now
I really, really wanna rock right now
I wanna see your ass in your elbows
I wanna see your ass in your elbows
(Shoulders, knees, toes)
(Shoulders, knees, toes)
(Shoulders, knees, toes)
I wanna see your ass in your elbows

Girl bad, girl got horns in her halo
Comin' for the hooter and the G's and the queso
Face get beat, tell her come and get a facial
And the liquor get her snappin' like paper
These hoes all want the same thing
White fence, big house, name change
Cross me, seguinte le blanco
Soy Mona Lisa, Picasso
(Spanish)
I know this is what you want
That's why I'mma back it up
(Spanish)
But I love it
Do the beggar, pull it up

She wanna rock right now
Said she was straight, but she not right now
Act like a saint, but a thot right now
All in my face, told her "not right now"
Right now
She wanna rock right now
Said she was straight, but she not right now
Act like a saint, but a thot right now
All in my face, told her "not right now"
Right now
(I wanna see your ass in your elbows)
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bang, bang, Bobby!
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
B.o.b, B.O.B, I said B.O.B
