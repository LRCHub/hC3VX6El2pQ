Better off without you
I'm doing good on my own
Better off without you
I'm doing good just on my

Came thru
Me in your path
What's a house made of glass
To a hurricane

Broke through
Shattered no time
To know which parts were mine
But I'm glad you came

Starstruck
I was in luck
If it wasn't for us
I'd still be the same

Thank you
Wasting my time
Helped me find my right mind
You're my last mistake

Better off without you
I'm doing good on my own
Better off without you
I'm doing good just on my

Better off without you
I'm doing good on my own
Better off without you
I'm doing good just on my own

Sky blue
Wind on my back
Thunder storms never last
In a summer daze

Breakthrough
Showers or shine
I know I'll be alright
Cus I'm on my way

Better off without you
I'm doing good on my own
Better off without you
I'm doing good just on my

Better off without you
I'm doing good on my own
Better off without you
I'm doing good just on my own

I never knew what I was made of
What was I afraid of
I'm doing good just on my own
I buried my fears in a field of
Dreams that I hope I'll
Never see

Better off without you
I'm doing good on my own
Better off without you
I'm doing good just on my

Better off without you
I'm doing good on my own
Better off without you
I'm doing good just on my own
